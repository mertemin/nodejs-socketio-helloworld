# node.js Socket.IO Hello World
This is an `hello world` example for node.js and Socket.IO (together with a sample ejs template). This example is quite straight-forward for anyone to grasp the idea of events between server and client. In fact, example also stands for a simple example of ejs template.

## Why?
Sometimes we really need a `Hello World` example, especially when we are working on a new technology. On my first day exprimenting node.js I spent quite some time putting node.js, Socket.IO and a template engine (in this case it is ejs together). When I finally managed to do it, I decided to share this publicly.
